		  A <b>desktop</b> computer is a personal computer in a form intended for regular use at a single location 
					desk/table due to its size and power requirements, as opposed to a laptop whose rechargeable 
					battery and compact dimensions allow it to be regularly carried and used in different locations. 
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
					A <b>laptop</b> or a notebook is a portable personal computer with a clamshell form factor, suitable 
					for mobile use. There was a difference between laptops and notebooks in the past, but nowadays 
					it has gradually died away. Laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings, including at work, 
					in education, and for personal multimedia. <br/><br/>
					
					A <b>tablet</b> computer is a mobile computer with a touchscreen display, circuitry and battery in a single unit. 
					Tablets come equipped with sensors, including cameras, a microphone and an accelerometer, and the touchscreen 
					display uses finger or stylus gestures substituting for the use of computer mouse and keyboard.
